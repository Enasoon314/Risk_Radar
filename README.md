# Risk_Radar

Risk_Radar is a web application for detecting potential financial scams in messages. It outputs a risk level (Low/Medium/High) along with the reasoning (e.g., suspicious links, high-value promises). Built with React and Vite for fast development and hot-reloading.

## Template Info

This project started from a minimal React + Vite template, which provides:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) using Babel for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) using SWC for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

For production development, using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules is recommended. See the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for integration info.
